Programming Background

Prior to attending Oregon State I had no experience programming. I have done 
well so far during my time at Oregon State, and have enjoyed learning new 
programming languages and getting some experience. I have so far learned C, 
C++, and assembly language.

So far my favorite programming project is a game that I made for the final
project in CS 165. It was a basketball game where two players could select
different types of shots they would like to do (layup, jump shot, 3 pointer)
and the different types of shots would have different benefits to them,
different odds of scoring or getting the shot blocked. It was a lot of work,
but it was fun and it was really rewarding when I got it to work correctly and
my wife and I played it together to try it out.
